        <div class="lb-rtxt"> 
         <p><b>5.1 Service Fees. </b>We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. We will invoice you from our registered office at the address of your establishment (as registered with the tax authorities, if applicable) receiving the Services in accordance with the applicable indirect tax laws. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Service Offerings as described on the Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff, or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding unless required by law. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments. You acknowledge that AISPL may display the applicable fees and charges for the Service Offerings on the Site in USD (or such other currency as AISPL may deem fit). However, AISPL will invoice you in INR calculated and converted in accordance with the conversion rate determined by us on the date of invoice (&quot;INR Equivalent Fees&quot;). You will only be liable to pay the INR Equivalent Fees indicated in each invoice.</p> 
         <p><b>5.2 Taxes.</b> All fees and charges payable under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or local indirect taxes (&quot;Taxes&quot;) that AISPL is legally obligated to charge under the applicable laws. For the purpose of this clause, local indirect taxes include Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), which includes the Central Goods and Services Tax (&quot;Central Tax&quot;), the State Goods and Services Tax (&quot;State Tax&quot;), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (&quot;UT Tax&quot;), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (&quot;Integrated Tax&quot;) as may be applicable. The Taxes charged by AISPL will be stated in the invoice pursuant to applicable laws. AISPL may charge and you will pay any applicable Taxes, which are stated separately on the invoice. As per the statutory requirement under GST, you will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST registered address, legal name and GSTIN (&quot;GST Information&quot;) in order for AISPL to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable legal requirements. In the event, the GST invoice is incorrect, you will inform us in a timely manner, to enable AISPL to correct the GST tax invoice. AISPL will determine the place of supply for the Services based on the GST Information provided by you and accordingly, charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to us are for our account. You will pay the fees and charges in our invoice in full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If you separately deposit applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the applicable government treasury and issue us a withholding tax certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the withholding tax certificate in original form, we will reimburse to you an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited.</p>
